# Election Analysis
## Overview of project
The prupose of this assignment was to help with local election results in Colorado.  The Board of Elections has requested help in completeing an audit of a recent election.  The requirements needed for this audit were: 
1. Count the total number of votes submitted.
2. Create a list of all the candidates in the election and count each of their votes.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate won.
4. Determine who the winner was based on the popular vote.

The Challenege part of the project also included:
5. Calculate how many votes were cast in each county.
6. Calculate the percentage of voters in each county.
7. Determine which county had the largest turnout.
8. Save the election results in a sepereate .txt file

## Audit Results
After completeing the audit, the following was found:
- Total Votes: 369,711
- The Counties where the election was held along with the percentage of votes and total vote count
  -Jefferson: 10.5% 38,855 votes
  -Denver: 82.82% 306,055 votes
  -Arapahoe: 6.7% 24,801 votes
- The candidates were along with percentage of votes won and total votes received
  -Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  -Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272892)
  -Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

- Diana Degette was the election winner having received 272,892 votes which was 73.8% of the total vote count. 

## Audit Summery
The code written for this election audit has given us very detailed results.  The election committee now knows the total votes, how many votes each candidate received and what the election turnout was in each county.  This information can also show where more work needs to be done to have a higher voter turnout in the different counties.  In addition, this code can be used for similar elections in the future.  Depending on what else the elction committee could be intersted to know, more code could be added or modified to meet new criteria.  Also, if the results do not need to be as detailed, lines of code can be removed such as the percentage of votes from the counties, if that infromation is not needed and if only looking for total vote count.
